       <i> A theory is a systematic and rational form of abstract thinking about a phenomenon, or the conclusions derived from such thinking.</i>
        <p ><font color="red" face="Arial" size="4">It involves contemplative and logical reasoning, often supported by processes such as observation, experimentation, and research.</font></p> 
       </b><b> Theories can be scientific, falling within the realm of empirical and testable knowledge, or they may belong to non-scientific disciplines, such as philosophy, art, or sociology.
         In some cases, theories may exist independently of any formal discipline.</b>
